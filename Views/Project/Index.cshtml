                    <b>Challenges:</b> The biggest challenge was vertical alignment, with responsive design in mind. Two areas I had trouble aligning vertically were
                    making sure that the fixed navbar wasn't covering text in the body, and keeping the footer stuck to the bottom.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <b>Solutions:</b> Adding padding to the body top helps prevent the fixed navbar from covering text. The footer was floating up was really an issue of text breaking out of a container
                    with a calulated height. This was fixed by adding a min-height to the container so the text doesn't break out.

                    <b>What I learned:</b> I learned that designing a simple website from scratch can be difficult,
                    not in terms of code complexity but in terms of choosing colors, designing layouts, figuring out what look you want to acheive, etc.
                    With Bootstrap I learned: using the grid system, flexbox, aligning text, navbars, and more. I also learned that you can use calc() in css to calculate height.
